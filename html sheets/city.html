    <p>Manchester City continued their impressive form with a commanding 3-1 victory over Bournemouth at the Etihad Stadium. The match was filled with drama, goals, and red cards, keeping fans on the edge of their seats until the final whistle.</p>

    <p>Omar Mamouche opened the scoring for City in the 14th minute, finishing off a slick passing move with a clinical strike. The early goal set the tone for City’s dominance in the first half, as they dictated the tempo and created multiple chances.</p>

    <p>In the 38th minute, Bernardo Silva doubled City's lead with a delightful finish after receiving a precise pass from Kevin De Bruyne. Silva’s movement and composure in the box showcased his class, leaving Bournemouth’s defense scrambling.</p>

    <p>The match took a fiery turn in the second half when Mateo Kovačić received a red card in the 67th minute for a reckless challenge. The dismissal gave Bournemouth a glimmer of hope as they tried to mount a comeback against 10-man City.</p>

    <p>Bournemouth’s ambitions were short-lived, however, as they too were reduced to 10 men in the 73rd minute when Lewis Cook saw red for a second bookable offense. The match became a tense affair, with both sides battling hard in midfield and tempers flaring.</p>

    <p>Despite the numerical disadvantage, City regained control and sealed the victory in the 89th minute. Nico Gonzalez netted the third goal, tapping in from close range after a well-worked corner routine. The Etihad erupted in celebration as City fans sensed another three points secured.</p>

    <p>Bournemouth managed to pull one back in stoppage time, with Daniel Jebisson scoring a consolation goal in the 90+6th minute. Jebisson’s effort was a moment of pride for the visitors, but it wasn’t enough to salvage a result.</p>

    <p>The win keeps Manchester City firmly in the title race, showcasing their resilience even when facing adversity. Manager Pep Guardiola praised his team’s mental strength and adaptability after the match, highlighting their ability to overcome challenges.</p>

    <p>Bournemouth, on the other hand, will reflect on the missed opportunity, as the red card and defensive lapses cost them dearly. They showed spirit in the final moments but were ultimately outclassed by City’s quality.</p>

    <p>City’s scorers on the day were Omar Mamouche (14’), Bernardo Silva (38’), and Nico Gonzalez (89’), while Bournemouth’s lone goal came from D. Jebisson (90+6’). The red cards for Kovačić (67’) and Cook (73’) added an extra layer of drama to an already intense match.</p>
