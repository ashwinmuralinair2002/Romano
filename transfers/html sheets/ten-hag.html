  <p>With Xabi Alonso set to depart Bayer Leverkusen for Real Madrid, the Bundesliga club is actively seeking a successor. Erik ten Hag, the former Manchester United and Ajax manager, has emerged as a leading candidate for the role.</p>

  <p>Ten Hag, who has been out of management since his departure from Manchester United in October 2024, is reportedly in advanced talks with Leverkusen. His experience in European competitions and a track record of developing young talent make him an attractive option for the club. <a href="https://talksport.com/football/3230991/erik-ten-hag-ajax-snub-bayer-leverkusen-job-man-utd/" target="_blank">[talkSPORT]</a></p>

  <p>During his tenure at Ajax from 2017 to 2022, Ten Hag led the team to three Eredivisie titles and a memorable run to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals in 2019. His tactical acumen and emphasis on attacking football align with Leverkusen's playing philosophy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag" target="_blank">[Wikipedia]</a></p>

  <p>Leverkusen's sporting director, Simon Rolfes, is keen to appoint a manager who can build upon the foundations laid by Alonso. The club's recent success, including a historic Bundesliga title, has raised expectations, and Ten Hag's profile fits the bill. <a href="https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2025/5/22/24435162/the-rebuild-begins-bayer-leverkusen-could-be-choosing-between-erik-ten-hag-and-cesc-fabregas" target="_blank">[Bavarian Football Works]</a></p>

  <p>While Ten Hag is considered the frontrunner, Leverkusen is also evaluating other candidates. Cesc FÃ bregas, currently managing Italian side Como 1907, is another name linked to the position. However, his lack of top-flight managerial experience may be a concern. <a href="https://www.getfootballnewsgermany.com/2025/cesc-fabregas-and-erik-ten-hag-lead-the-way-in-bayer-leverkusen-search-for-xabi-alonsos-successor/" target="_blank">[Get German Football News]</a></p>

  <p>Financial considerations could play a role in the final decision. Ten Hag's salary demands are reportedly higher than what Leverkusen typically offers, but the club may be willing to make an exception for a manager of his caliber. <a href="https://tribuna.com/en/news/2025-05-05-bayer-leverkusen-narrow-down-search-for-new-coach-erik-ten-hag-cesc-fabregas-and-xavi-in/" target="_blank">[Tribuna]</a></p>

  <p>Ten Hag's familiarity with the Bundesliga, having previously coached Bayern Munich's reserve team, adds to his appeal. His understanding of German football culture and language proficiency could facilitate a smoother transition. <a href="https://meritking.news/erik-ten-hag-a-serious-candidate-for-bayer-leverkusen-job-as-xabi-alonso-nears-real-madrid-switch/" target="_blank">[Meritking News]</a></p>

  <p>As Leverkusen prepares for the upcoming season, securing a manager capable of sustaining and enhancing the team's performance is paramount. Ten Hag's proven track record suggests he could be the ideal candidate to lead the club into a new era.</p>

  <p>Further developments are expected in the coming days as negotiations progress. Leverkusen fans eagerly await official confirmation of the club's next managerial appointment.</p>
