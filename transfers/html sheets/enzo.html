  <p>Chelsea have made it unequivocally clear that Enzo Fernández is not for sale, despite persistent interest from Real Madrid. The Argentine midfielder, who joined the Blues in January 2023 for a British-record fee of £106.8 million, remains a central figure in the club's long-term plans.</p>

  <p>Real Madrid, under the management of Xabi Alonso, have been seeking to reinforce their midfield, with Fernández emerging as a potential target. However, Chelsea's stance is firm; they have no intention of entertaining offers for the 24-year-old, who is under contract until 2032. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/chelsea-determined-to-keep-enzo-fernandez-despite-real-madrid-interest" target="_blank">[The Guardian]</a></p>

  <p>Fernández has been instrumental in Chelsea's midfield, contributing significantly to the team's performances. Under head coach Enzo Maresca, he has not only improved his goal tally but has also taken on leadership responsibilities, often captaining the side in Reece James' absence. <a href="https://as.com/futbol/internacional/portazo-del-chelsea-al-madrid-por-enzo-n/" target="_blank">[AS]</a></p>

  <p>Despite reports suggesting that Fernández was seen house-hunting in Madrid, both the player and the club have dismissed any notions of a transfer. His agent has reiterated that Fernández is committed to Chelsea and has no intention of leaving. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/transfer-talk/news/agent-fernandez-has-no-intention-of-leaving-chelsea_536180.html" target="_blank">[Sports Mole]</a></p>

  <p>Real Madrid's financial constraints further complicate any potential deal. With Chelsea valuing Fernández highly and unwilling to negotiate, the Spanish club may need to explore alternative options to bolster their midfield. <a href="https://www.90min.com/chelsea-issue-firm-response-real-madrid-enzo-fernandez-interest" target="_blank">[90min]</a></p>

  <p>Fernández's importance to Chelsea cannot be overstated. Since his arrival, he has made over 100 appearances, tallying 14 goals and 19 assists. His versatility allows him to play in various midfield roles, making him an invaluable asset to the team. <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/rumour-chelsea-s-stance-enzo-fernandez-s-future-club-amid-real-madrid-links-comes-light-reports" target="_blank">[Sportskeeda]</a></p>

  <p>As Chelsea prepare for the upcoming season, retaining key players like Fernández is crucial to their ambitions. The club's leadership is focused on building a competitive squad capable of challenging for domestic and European honors, with Fernández playing a pivotal role in that vision.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, despite Real Madrid's interest, Chelsea's message is clear: Enzo Fernández is not for sale. The midfielder remains committed to the club, and both parties are aligned in their goal of achieving success together in the coming years.</p>
